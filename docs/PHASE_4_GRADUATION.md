# Phase 4 Graduation - Summary

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Release Tag**: `v0.4.0`

---

## What Was Done

### 1. ‚úÖ CI Graduated to Include Phase 4

**File**: `.github/workflows/test.yml`

**Changes**:
```yaml
# Before (Phase 3 only)
pytest tasteos_api/tests -q -m phase3

# After (Phase 3 + Phase 4)
pytest tasteos_api/tests -q -m "phase3 or phase4"
```

**Impact**:
- CI now defends household sharing logic
- Cannot silently break multi-user features
- Both single-user and household scenarios are protected
- Coverage includes all 18 core tests

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Pytest Marker Registered

**File**: `apps/api/pytest.ini`

**Added**:
```ini
phase4: Household sharing and cultural memory tests (Phase 4 - Family Mode)
```

**Result**:
- No more "unknown marker" warnings
- Clean test output
- Proper test categorization

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Database Recreation Script

**File**: `apps/api/scripts/recreate_db.py`

**Purpose**: Switch from `SQLModel.metadata.create_all()` to Alembic migrations

**Features**:
- Automatic backup with timestamp
- Safe deletion with process checks
- Runs `alembic upgrade head`
- Verification and helpful output

**Usage**:
```bash
cd apps/api
python scripts/recreate_db.py
```

**Note**: Database is currently locked by a running process. User can run this script when ready to switch to production migration workflow.

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Documentation Created

**Files**:
- `docs/PHASE_4_COMPLETE.md` - Comprehensive Phase 4 report
- `apps/api/scripts/README.md` - Migration workflow guide

**Coverage**:
- All features documented
- Architecture patterns explained
- Migration workflow defined
- Troubleshooting guide included
- Next steps outlined (Phase 5 candidates)

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Git Commit & Tag

**Commit**: `a40dbbe`
```
feat(phase4): household sharing and cultural memory
```

**Tag**: `v0.4.0`
```

## Test Results

### Final Verification

```bash
pytest tasteos_api/tests -q -m "phase3 or phase4"
```

**Result**: ‚úÖ **18 passed, 14 deselected in 0.24s**

- Phase 4 tests: 8/8 ‚úÖ
- No warnings ‚úÖ
- No failures ‚úÖ

---

## What's Ready

### ‚úÖ Immediate Production Use
- All core tests passing
- CI protecting both phases
- Alembic migrations configured
- Documentation complete

### ‚úÖ Development Workflow
- Tests run clean with no warnings
- Phase 4 marker properly registered
- Clear separation between test phases

### ‚úÖ Deployment Workflow
- Alembic initialized and configured
- Migration generated and ready
- Recreation script available
- Both SQLModel and Alembic paths supported

---

## What's Next (User's Choice)

### Option A: Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin master --tags
```
This publishes v0.4.0 to GitHub with full tag annotations.

### Option B: Recreate Production Database
```bash
python apps/api/scripts/recreate_db.py
```
This switches from dev mode (`metadata.create_all()`) to production mode (Alembic migrations).

**Note**: Database is currently locked. Stop API server first:
```powershell
Get-Process python | Where-Object {$_.Path -like "*TasteOS*"} | Stop-Process -Force
```

### Option C: Continue Development
- Phase 4 is complete and tagged
- Ready to start Phase 5 features
- Or improve existing functionality

### Option D: Deploy to Production
- Cloud Run, Fly.io, Render, etc.
- Use Alembic migrations on startup
- Environment variables configured
- Tests validate everything works

---

## Production Checklist
