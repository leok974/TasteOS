# Phase 5.1: Health Mode - COMPLETE ✅

**Tag**: `v0.5.0-health`  
**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Status**: All tests passing (2 Phase 5 tests, 18 Phase 3+4 regression tests)

## Overview

Phase 5.1 introduces **Health Mode** - the ability to store per-person nutrition goals, dietary restrictions, and cultural preferences, then evaluate whether today's shared meal plan aligns with everyone's needs.

## Demo Story

> **"TasteOS can store per-person nutrition goals, allergies, and cultural rules. It can evaluate today's shared meal plan for the household. It can point out where someone's allergy/restriction is violated and how to fix it using the family's own way of cooking that dish. It can estimate whether people are on track for protein/calories today."**

## What Was Built

### 1. Data Models

#### UserNutritionProfile
- **Purpose**: Store per-user dietary goals, restrictions, and cultural preferences
- **Key Fields**:
  - `user_id` (unique FK to users) - One profile per user
  - `calories_daily`, `protein_daily_g`, `carbs_daily_g`, `fat_daily_g` - Optional daily goals
  - `restrictions` (JSON) - e.g. `{"dairy_free": true, "shellfish_allergy": true}`
  - `cultural_notes` (Text) - e.g. "No pork for dad", "Halal at home"
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "calories_daily": 2200,
    "protein_daily_g": 140,
    "restrictions": {"dairy_free": true},
    "cultural_notes": "No pork, lighter sodium for Dad"
  }
  ```

#### RecipeNutritionInfo
- **Purpose**: Store computed nutrition for household recipe memories (culturally-aware nutrition)
- **Key Fields**:
  - `recipe_memory_id` (unique FK to recipe_memory) - One nutrition per recipe memory
  - `calories`, `protein_g`, `carbs_g`, `fat_g` - Nutrition data
  - `micronotes` (JSON) - Extended nutrition data (e.g. sodium_mg, fiber_g)
  - `computed_at` - Timestamp of calculation
- **Note**: This is not generic nutrition - it's tied to "YOUR family's Rasta Pasta"
- **Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "recipe_memory_id": "uuid-here",
    "calories": 650,
    "protein_g": 32,
    "carbs_g": 48,
    "fat_g": 28,
    "micronotes": {"sodium_mg": 800}
  }
  ```

### 2. API Endpoints

#### GET /api/v1/nutrition/profile
- Returns the current user's nutrition profile
- Returns 404 if profile not found with helpful message
- **Security**: Only returns current user's profile

#### POST /api/v1/nutrition/profile
- Creates or updates the current user's nutrition profile
- **Security**: Always uses `current_user.id` - client cannot set another user's profile
- Returns 201 on create, 200 on update
- **Example Request**:
  ```json
  {
    "calories_daily": 2200,
    "protein_daily_g": 140,
    "restrictions": {"dairy_free": false},
    "cultural_notes": "Extra protein for lifting"
  }
  ```

#### GET /api/v1/nutrition/today (The "Money Endpoint")
- **Purpose**: Evaluates today's meal plan against household members' nutrition goals and restrictions
- **Complex Logic** (193 lines):
  1. Fetches today's MealPlan for household
  2. Gets all household members
  3. Gets nutrition profiles for all members
  4. Extracts dish names from meal plan (breakfast/lunch/dinner/snacks)
  5. Matches dishes to RecipeMemory
  6. Fetches RecipeNutritionInfo for matched memories
  7. Builds per-user assessment:
     - Compares estimated totals vs goals
     - Checks dietary restrictions (dairy_free, shellfish_allergy)
     - Detects violations in dish names/notes
     - Suggests substitutions from RecipeMemory.substitutions
     - Includes cultural_notes
  8. Returns summary with issues_count and per_user details

- **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "date": "2025-10-28",
    "household_id": "uuid-here",
    "summary": "⚠️ 2 issues found",
    "meal_plan": {
      "breakfast": ["Grilled Chicken Bowl"],
      "lunch": ["Grilled Chicken Bowl"],
      "dinner": ["Rasta Pasta (Salmon Cajun)"],
      "snacks": []
    },
    "per_user": {
      "user-1-uuid": {
        "goals": {"calories_daily": 2200, "protein_daily_g": 140},
        "est_today": {"calories": 1650, "protein_g": 112.0},
        "cultural_notes": "High protein for lifting"
      },
      "user-2-uuid": {
        "goals": {"calories_daily": 1800, "protein_daily_g": 100},
        "est_today": {"calories": 1650, "protein_g": 112.0},
        "restrictions": {"dairy_free": true},
        "violations": [{
          "dish": "Rasta Pasta (Salmon Cajun)",
          "reason": "May contain dairy (conflicts with dairy_free restriction)"
        }],
        "suggestions": [
          "Substitution from family recipe: use coconut milk instead of cream"
        ],
        "cultural_notes": "No dairy - sensitive stomach"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### 3. Test Infrastructure

#### Test Fixtures (added to conftest.py)
- `second_user` - Additional household member for multi-user testing
- `attach_second_user_to_household` - Creates HouseholdMembership with role="member"
- `nutrition_profile_factory` - Async factory for creating/updating profiles
- `recipe_with_nutrition_factory` - Creates RecipeMemory + RecipeNutritionInfo pair
- `todays_household_plan` - Creates MealPlan for today with test dishes

#### Test Files
- **test_nutrition_profile.py**: Tests profile CRUD and user isolation
  - `test_user_can_set_and_get_nutrition_profile` - POST then GET, verify roundtrip
  
- **test_nutrition_today.py**: Tests household nutrition evaluation
  - `test_household_nutrition_summary_for_today` - Multi-user household with dietary restrictions
  - Validates:
    * Multi-user evaluation
    * Dairy violation detection
    * Substitution suggestions
    * Macro calculation accuracy

### 4. Migration

- **File**: `6a0a7c5c8f6b_phase_5_1_nutrition_profiles_and_.py`
- **Tables Created**:
  - `user_nutrition_profiles` with unique index on `user_id`
  - `recipe_nutrition_info` with unique index on `recipe_memory_id`
- **Note**: Migration also captured pending Phase 4 columns (grocery_items.household_id, etc.)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Patterns
- **User Isolation**: POST /nutrition/profile always uses `current_user.id` from JWT
- **Household Scoping**: GET /nutrition/today requires `get_current_household` dependency
- **Profile Privacy**: Users can only view their own profile via GET /nutrition/profile

### Dietary Restriction Detection Logic
```python
# From GET /nutrition/today endpoint
if profile.restrictions.get("dairy_free"):
    dairy_keywords = ["cream", "cheese", "milk", "dairy", "butter", "yogurt"]
    for keyword in dairy_keywords:
        if keyword in dish_name.lower() or keyword in origin_notes.lower():
            violations.append({
                "dish": dish_name,
                "reason": f"May contain dairy (conflicts with dairy_free restriction)"
            })
            
if profile.restrictions.get("shellfish_allergy"):
    shellfish_keywords = ["shrimp", "crab", "lobster", "shellfish", "prawn"]
    # Similar detection logic...
```

### Substitution Suggestion Generation
```python
# Extracts substitutions from RecipeMemory.substitutions JSON field
if violations:
    for recipe_memory in matched_memories:
        if recipe_memory.substitutions:
            # Example: {"note": "coconut milk instead of cream"}
            suggestions.append(
                f"Substitution from family recipe: {recipe_memory.substitutions.get('note', '')}"
            )
```

### Macro Estimation Calculation
```python
# Sums nutrition info for all dishes in today's meal plan
for nutrition_info in matched_nutrition_infos:
    total_calories += nutrition_info.calories or 0
    total_protein += nutrition_info.protein_g or 0
    total_carbs += nutrition_info.carbs_g or 0
    total_fat += nutrition_info.fat_g or 0

# Compares against user's goals
if profile.protein_daily_g and total_protein < profile.protein_daily_g:
    # Note: Under protein goal
```

## Test Results

```bash
# Phase 5 tests
$ pytest tasteos_api/tests -q -m phase5
..
2 passed, 32 deselected in 0.12s

# Regression tests (Phase 3 + 4)
$ pytest tasteos_api/tests -q -m "phase3 or phase4"
..................
18 passed, 16 deselected in 0.24s

# Summary: 20/20 tests passing (2 Phase 5 + 18 regression)
```

## Key Design Decisions

1. **One Profile Per User**: Used unique constraint on `user_id` in UserNutritionProfile
2. **One Nutrition Per Recipe Memory**: Used unique constraint on `recipe_memory_id` in RecipeNutritionInfo
3. **Cultural Nutrition**: RecipeNutritionInfo is tied to household recipe memories, not generic recipes
4. **JSON for Flexibility**: Used JSON for restrictions and micronotes to allow easy extension
5. **Client Cannot Set user_id**: POST /profile always uses current_user.id for security
6. **Keyword-Based Detection**: Simple but effective approach for detecting dietary restrictions in dish names
7. **Family-Based Suggestions**: Substitutions come from RecipeMemory.substitutions (family's own methods)

## Demo Flow

### 1. Set Up Profiles
```bash
# User 1: High protein, okay with dairy
POST /api/v1/nutrition/profile
{
  "calories_daily": 2200,
  "protein_daily_g": 140,
  "restrictions": {"dairy_free": false}
}

# User 2: Dairy-free
POST /api/v1/nutrition/profile
{
  "calories_daily": 1800,
  "protein_daily_g": 100,
  "restrictions": {"dairy_free": true}
}
```

### 2. Create Recipe with Nutrition
```python
# RecipeMemory for "Rasta Pasta"
{
  "dish_name": "Rasta Pasta (Salmon Cajun)",
  "origin_notes": "Sunday routine sauce: coconut milk + heavy cream",
  "substitutions": {"note": "coconut milk instead of cream"}
}

# RecipeNutritionInfo for above
{
  "calories": 650,
  "protein_g": 32,
  "carbs_g": 48,
  "fat_g": 28,
  "micronotes": {"dairy": true}
}
```

### 3. Create Today's Meal Plan
```python
{
  "date": "2025-10-28",
  "breakfast": ["Grilled Chicken Bowl"],
  "lunch": ["Grilled Chicken Bowl"],
  "dinner": ["Rasta Pasta (Salmon Cajun)"],
  "snacks": []
}
```

### 4. Evaluate
```bash
GET /api/v1/nutrition/today
```

**Result**: System detects that User 2 (dairy-free) has a violation with Rasta Pasta and suggests using coconut milk substitution from family's recipe memory!

## Next Steps

Phase 5.1 is complete! Future work could include:

### Phase 5.2: Growth Mode (Household Invitations)
- Household invitation system
- New member onboarding
- Profile setup wizard
- Household joining flows

### Future Enhancements
- **Advanced Restriction Detection**: Use LLM to analyze recipe ingredients
- **Nutrition Calculation**: Auto-calculate nutrition from recipe ingredients
- **Goal Tracking**: Track progress over time (weekly/monthly views)
- **Personalized Suggestions**: ML-based meal suggestions per user
- **Allergen Warnings**: More comprehensive allergen detection
- **Shopping List Integration**: Flag grocery items that conflict with restrictions

## Comparison to Phase 4

| Aspect | Phase 4 (Family Mode) | Phase 5.1 (Health Mode) |
|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Focus | Household sharing | Individual health tracking |
| Models | RecipeMemory, HouseholdMembership | UserNutritionProfile, RecipeNutritionInfo |
| Key Feature | Cultural recipe knowledge | Dietary restriction detection |
| Complexity | Medium (household scoping) | High (multi-user evaluation) |
| Test Count | 8 tests | 2 tests (but complex multi-user scenarios) |
| LOC Added | ~500 | ~900 |

## Lessons Learned

1. **Complex Evaluation Logic**: The GET /nutrition/today endpoint is the most complex so far (193 lines)
2. **Multi-User Testing**: Needed careful fixture design for multi-user scenarios
3. **JSON Flexibility**: JSON fields for restrictions/micronotes allow easy extension
4. **SQLite Migration Limitations**: Had to work around SQLite's ALTER constraint limitations
5. **Test-First Design**: Detailed test specs from user helped clarify requirements
6. **Keyword Detection Works**: Simple keyword-based restriction detection is effective
7. **Family Context Matters**: Tying nutrition to household recipe memories (not generic recipes) is key differentiator
